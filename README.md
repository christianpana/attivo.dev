## Accessing Feature Flags

To retrieve and monitor feature flags, use the following locations:

- **Window:** The flag configuration is stored as `window.__feature_flags__`.
- **Local Storage:** Look for the key `__feature_flags__` for a persisted copy.
- **Session Storage:** A session-specific copy is also available with the same key.

## Live Updates

The feature flag data is automatically updated whenever a flag is changed. To capture live changes, listen for these events:

- `ATTIVO_HOST_INIT` â€“ triggered during initialization with the default flags.
- `ATTIVO_FEATURE_FLAG_UPDATE` â€“ triggered whenever a flag is updated.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('ATTIVO_HOST_INIT', handleHostInit);
window.addEventListener('ATTIVO_FEATURE_FLAG_UPDATE', handleFlagUpdate);
```

Monitoring these events ensures that your app instantly reflects any changes made to the feature flags.
